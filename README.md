# CupFlow
# CFD simulation via OpenFOAM. Solved with icoFoam solver 
#
# Cup is 10cm * 10cm with flow speed 1m/s entering from the left wall
#
# Included are the case files for simple flow over a cavity.
# 
#
# 
# .gif file is displays the flow speed in x direction at increasing heights from the top of the cup. 
# Each frame shifts the data collection by 1cm. 
# More iterations could produce a smoother transition.
